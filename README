Yodl implements a pre-document language and tools to process it.  The idea
behind Yodl is that you write up a document in a pre-language, then use the
tools (e.g. yodl2html(1)) to convert it to some final document language.
Current converters are for HTML, man, LaTeX, text and a (very) experimental
xml converter.  Main document types are "article", "report", "book" "manpage"
and "letter".  The Yodl document language was designed to be easy to use as
well as extensible.


To create the program from its sources, either descend into the yodl
directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, binary ready-to-install versions of the yodl program are
available in verious Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=yodl&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
