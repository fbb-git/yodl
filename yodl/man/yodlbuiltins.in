manpagesynopsis()
            This manual page lists the standard builtins of the Yodl package.

manpagedescription()
            The following list shows the builtins defined by the Yodl converters
define and which can be used in Yodl documents. Refer to the Yodl user
guide, distributed with the Yodl package, for a full description.

The following list shows all builtins of the package in alphabetical
order.

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if
Yodl's tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used. The builtins
tt(INCLUDEFILE, NOEXPANDINCLUDE) and tt(NOEXPANDPATHINCLUDE) are affected by
this new behavior.

manpagefiles()
    The files in bf(@STD_INCLUDE@) define the converter's macro packages. The
scripts bf(yodl2tex), bf(yodl2html), bf(yodl2man) etc. perform the
conversions.
