manpagedescription()

    This manual page describes the various shell scripts that convert
    documents in the Yodl language to other formats. The basic converters
    are:
    itemization(
    it() bf(yodl2html)(1): converts to HTML, writes a file with the extension
        bf(.html).
    it() bf(yodl2man)(1): converts to nroff `man' format, writes bf(.man). Can
        be further processed with e.g. bf(nroff -Tascii -man)
        em(file)bf(.man).
    it() bf(yodl2latex)(1): converts to LaTeX output, writes bf(.latex). Can
        be further processed with, e.g., bf(latex) em(file)bf(.latex).
    it() bf(yodl2txt)(1): converts to plain ASCII, writes bf(.txt). This is a
        very rudimentary converter, a last-resort.
    )
    COMMENT(
        dit(yodl2ms:) converts to nroff `ms' format, writes bf(.ms). Can be
            further processed with e.g. bf(nroff -T)em(format) bf(-mgs) 
            em(file)bf(.ms); em(format) being e.g., bf(ascii) or bf(ps).
        dit(yodl2sgml:) converts to SGML, writes bf(.sgml). Implemented for
        backward compatibility at our site, producing output for our `hacked 
        Linuxdoc-SGML mutant'.
        dit(yodl2texinfo:) converts to texinfo, the GNU document standard. 
            writes bf(.texinfo).
    )

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if the
tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used (see below).


manpageoptions()

    The options are identical to those of the bf(yodl)(1) program.

    Additionally, the following options are available:
    itemization(
    it() tt(--no-warnings):nl()
        By default the convertors call bf(yodl)(1) using the tt(-w) flag. The
        option tt(--no-warnings) suppresses this flag.
    it() tt(--intermediate=<filename>):nl()
        By default, files used for the communication between yodl and yodlpost
        are removed following the conversion. The
        tt(--intermediate=<filename>) option may be provided to retain these
        files, called tt(<filename>) and tt(<filename>.idx).
    )

manpagefiles()

    Each bf(yodl2)em(format) converter requires a file em(format.yo) in Yodl's
    include path (e.g., tt(@STD_INCLUDE@)). This file is auto-loaded before
    tt(FILE) (see the synopsys) is loaded, to make the conversion to
    em(format) possible.
    
    The output is written to one or more files having the extension
    em(.format).
