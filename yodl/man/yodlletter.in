    The bf(letter) document type was implemented to write LaTeX() letters.

manpagedescription()

    The bf(letter) document type was specifically implemented to write
    LaTeX() letters, using LaTeX()'s bf(brief.cls) document class. It is
    available only for the LaTeX() (bf(yodl2latex)(1)) converter.

    This manual page briefly describes bf(Yodl)'s  bf(letter) document type.
    This document type is specific enough that it
    warrants a separate manpage.

    bf(letter) documents do not allow you to use the `standard' sectioning
    commands (e.g., bf(sect)() and bf(subsect)()).  You can, however, use
    macros that are normally used within such sections, such as
    bf(description)(), bf(itemization)(), bf(bf)() or bf(em)().

    Several specific macros, to be used in the em(preamble), are available for
    the bf(letter) document type. They are:
    itemization(
    it() bf(AfourEnlarged)bf(()): Enlarges the usable height of A4 paper by 2
        cm.: the top margin is reduced by 2 cm.
    it() bf(letteraddenda)bf((type)(value)): Adds an addendum at the end of a
        letter.  em(type) should be em(bijlagen) (i.e., em(appendices)),
        em(cc) or em(ps). Use NOTRANS(nl()) within the em(value) section if
        multiple addenda of a certain em(type) are used.
    it() bf(letteradmin)bf((yourdate)(yourref)): Puts em(yourletterfrom) and
        em(yourreference) elements in the letter. If left empty, two dashes
        are inserted.
    it() bf(letterfootitem)bf((name)(value)): Puts a footer at the bottom of
        letter-pages. Up to three will usually fit. For example,
        em(letterfootitem(e-mail)(f.b.brokken@rug.nl))
    it() bf(letterreplyto)bf((name)(address)(zip city)):
              Defines the `reply to' address.
    it() bf(letterto)bf((element)): Adds em(element) as an additional line to
        the address of the addressee. Use one bf(letterto()) element for each
        line of the addressee's address. Up to five lines will usually fit. A
        sixth line may be squeezed in, if necessary.
    )

    The bf(letter)) macro itself requires the following arguments:
    itemization(
    it() bf(language): select em(english), em(dutch), or another language
        supported by the bf(babel.sty) style;
    it() bf(date): the letter's date. Use your own date-convention. The text
        specified here will be used as the letter's date;
    it() bf(subject): a short indication as to why you wrote the letter
    it() bf(opening): the letter's opening, e.g., em(Dear Linus,);
    it() bf(salutation): the letter's closing phrase, e.g., em(Kind
        regards,);
    it() bf(author): the name of the letter's author. em(nl)em(()) macros can
        be used here, but the bf(brief) class will also restrict the width of
        the author-lines by itself.
