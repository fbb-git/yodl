manpagedescription()

Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and
tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document
in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. bf(yodl2html)(1)) to convert it
to some final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, 
man, LaTeX, text and an experimental xml converter.  Main
document types are "article", "report", "book" "manpage" and "letter".  The
Yodl document language is designed to be easy to use and extensible.

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if the
tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used (see below).

    The bf(yodl) program requires no files, but `normal' usage of the Yodl
    package requires macro files, by default installed in
    tt(@STD_INCLUDE@). The
    files in this directory are included by the converters bf(yodl2txt)(1)
    etc..
