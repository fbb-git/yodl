manpagedescription()

Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and
tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document
in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. bf(yodl2html)(1)) to convert it
to some final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, 
man, LaTeX, text and an experimental xml converter.  Main
document types are "article", "report", "book" "manpage" and "letter".  The
Yodl document language is designed to be easy to use and extensible.

manpagefiles()

    The bf(yodl) program requires no files, but `normal' usage of the Yodl
    package requires macro files, by default installed in
    tt(@STD_INCLUDE@). The
    files in this directory are included by the converters bf(yodl2txt)(1)
    etc..
