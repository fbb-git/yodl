                      Installing Yodl

Below the original contents of the file INSTALL.txt follows. As of Yodl
2.01.00, Yodl is available from http://yodl.sourceforge.net, or as a Debian
linux package.

To install Yodl as a binary package, the `dpkg' Debian package installer is
the preferred program to use to install Yodl. If you want to install Yodl from
its sources, download the source archive (yodl*.tar.gz), unpack it.

If you want to compile Yodl yourself, you'll probably need Icmake. Icmake is
available from http://icmake.sourceforge.net or as a Debian linux package.

To install Yodl using icmake proceed as follows:

    1. Define the appropriate locations in setLocations() (at the bottom) of
       INSTALL.im 

    2. then run:

        ./build programs
        ./build man 
        ./build manual
        ./build macros

NOTE: ./build programs must be first, ./build macros must be last, the other
      two are optional

    3. then do (probably as root) 

    (NOTE: `WHERE' (below) indicates the base directory under which you want
           to install the software. The paths in INSTALL.im refer to locations
           below WHERE. So, specifying WHERE as / will install under the
           system's root directory. All WHERE specifications must be
           identical).

    ./build install programs WHERE        - e.g., ./build install programs /
    ./build install man WHERE                     ./build install man /
    ./build install manual WHERE                  ./build install manual /
    ./build install macros WHERE                  ./build install macros /
    ./build install docs WHERE                    ./build install docs /

    For `./build install ...' there are no ordering requirements but at the 
    very least do 
        ./build install programs WHERE    - e.g., ./build install programs /
        ./build install macros WHERE              ./build install macros /

The following information describes the Yodl package from
the point of the system administrator. Issues such as the
installation of the package are addressed here.

1: Obtaining and installing Yodl

     The Yodl program and the distributed macro package can
be obtained at the ftp site ftp.lilypond.org in the direc-
tory pub/yodl/development.  Look for a file called yodl-
X.Y.Z.tar.gz, where X.Y.Z is the highest version number.
This is a gzipped archive containing all sources, documenta-
tion and macro files.

1.1: Configuring the yodl program

     Once you unpack the archive, configure the sourcetree
with a command that looks remotely like

             configure    # Check out the bin/set-yo.sh script
             make
             make install

The configuration process is quite versatile; it should run
flawlessly to detect your system and its defaults.  You may
alter various settings, see configure --help.

1.2: Installing the yodl program

     Once configured, type

         make all

to build everything.  If everything went ok, you can do

         make install

to install it. The executable, which is built as
src/out/yodl is created and copied to a system-wide program
directory. The macro package from macros/ is also placed in
a public directory, which is /usr/local/share/yodl by
default (you can change most directory names in the config-
ure process).  Furthermore, postprocessors and a number of
shell scripts (drivers of the yodl program) are copied to
your programs directory.

1.2.1: Prerequisites for the installation

     To successfully build and install the Yodl package, the
following tools must be present:

o    A C compiler and run-time environment. A POSIX-compli-
     ant compiler, libraries and set of header files should
     work without problems. The GNU gcc compiler 2.7 and
     above should work without a flaw.

o    GNU make

o    Typical building programs, such as, install. Most
     Unixes will have these.

o    /bin/sh: a POSIX-compliant shell interpreter. The GNU
     shell interpreter bash works without problems.

o    A number of `standard' tools should be present: sed,
     grep, etc.. These tools must furthermore include the
     code generators bison and flex (yacc- and lex looka-
     likes) to genererate the grammar parsers. The GNU
     implementations of these tools work like a charm.

o    A command that converts groff input into viewable for-
     mat.  The default setting for this command is troff
     -Tascii -man.
