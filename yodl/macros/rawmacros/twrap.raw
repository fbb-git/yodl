macro(twrap(value)) 
 (Used for man/ms conversions only: when called with a non-zero argument
before using the tt(tc, tnc, tac), and tt(tnac) macros then their contents are
wrapped in text blocks (tt(T{ ... T}) blocks). To end the wrapping
tt(twrap(0)) must be called. E.g., in the following row-definition the
contents of columns three and four are set in T-blocks when converting to
man/ms:
        verb(
    tr(\
        tc(one)tc(two)twrap(1)tc(one)tc(two)twrap(0)\
    )\
        )
