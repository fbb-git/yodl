macro(verb(text))
 (Sets tt(text) in verbatim mode: not subject to macro expansion or character
table expansion, and starting with Yodl version 4.00.00: not using tt(SUBST)
definitions. See also tt(veborg), which does not provide the protection
against tt(SUBST) definitions.

While converting Yodl-documents to target document types Yodl frequently uses
the (not further documented) builtin function tt(CHAR(X)XSUBST). In the
unlikely event that the text tt(XXSUBST+CHAR(40)...CHAR(41)) must be written
in a document, the sequence
    verb(
    XXSUBST++CHAR(C)HAR(40)...CHAR(C)HAR(41)
    )
    can be used.

 The text that is passed as argument to the tt(verb)-macro appears literally
on the output, usually in a teletype font (that depends on the output
format). This macro is for larger chunks, e.g., listings. 

 When unbalanced parameter lists are required, use tt(CHAR(C)HAR(40)) to get
tt(CHAR(40)) and tt(CHAR(C)HAR(41)) to get tt(CHAR(41)).)
