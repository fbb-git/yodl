macro(sethtmlfigureext(ext))
(Defines the filename extension for HTML figures, defaults to tt(.jpg). Note
that a leading dot must be included in tt(ext). The new extension takes effect
starting with the following usage of the tt(figure) macro.  It is only active
in html, but otherwise acts identically as NOEXPAND(setfigureext()).

    See also the tt(setlatexfigureext) macro.
