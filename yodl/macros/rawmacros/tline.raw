macro(tline(beginNr)(endNr))
 (This macro is used to insert a horizontal line spanning one or more columns
of a table defined by the tt(tbl) macro.

If tt(endNr) is not specified, and the tt(tline) call does not follow a
previous tt(line) call in which tt(endNr) em(was) specified, then a horizontal
line spanning the full width of the table is defined (except when converting
to plain text in which case a line of tt(beginNr) - (minus) characters is
written; if tt(beginNr) is not specified then a line of 60 - characters is
written).

If tt(endNr) is not specified, but the tt(tline) call follows previous tt(tline)
calls that did specify tt(endNr) then the current row is ended. 

If tt(endNr) is specified, then a horizontal line is set, starting at column
number tt(beginNr) continuing through column number tt(endNr). Note that these
are em(numbers), not em(offsets): tt(beginNr) should be at least 1, tt(endNr)
must at least be equal to tt(beginNr) and should be at most equal to the
number of columns in the table. The tt(beginNr) values of subsequent tt(tline)
calls refer to the same row as the first tt(tline) call, and must exceed
tt(endNr) of the previous tt(tline) call.
    
Examples:
        verb(
    tline()()       sets a line spanning the full table width
    tline(1)(1)     sets a line in column 1
    tline(3)(4)     sets another line in column 3 and 4
    tline()()       ends the previous line
    tline()()       sets a line spanning the full table width
        )
