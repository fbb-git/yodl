macro(tac(alignment)(contents)) 
 (This macro is one of the four macros that can be used to define the column
contents of the rows of tables that are defined by the tt(tbl)
macro. Alternatively, tt(tc, tnc), and tt(tnac) can be used.

The tt(tac) macro is used as argument of the tt(tr) macro. The cell's
alignment is defined by the tt(alignment) specification, containing at most
two alignment specifications: a horizontal alignment (one of c, l, r
(centered, left-aligned, right-aligned)) and a vertical alignment (one of t, b
(vertical top- and bottom-alignment)) (not all conversion types may support
all alignment types). Specifications other than c, l, r, b, and t and
specifications beyond the second one are ignored. The result of specifying
conflicting alignment types (e.g., tt(lr) or tt(tb)) is not defined.

When converting to tt(man), if the table's contents should span multiple rows,
then a bf(groff/troff)(1) em(text block) must be used. Since most tables do
not use this, a text block is not generated by default. To actually wrap the
contents of column elements in a text block while converting to tt(man) prefix
the first text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(twrap(1)), and end
the last text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(wrap(0)).

The macro tt(tac) recognizes tt(attrib).
