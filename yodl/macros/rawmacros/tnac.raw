macro(tnac(nCells)(alignment)(contents)) 
 (This macro is one of the four macros that can be used to define column
contents of rows of tables defined by the tt(tbl) macro. Alternatively, tt(tc,
tac), and tt(tnc) can be used.

The tt(tnac) macro is used as argument of the tt(tr) macro. Its first argument
defines the number of columns spanned by the contents (2nd argument) 
of the tt(tnc) macro. 

The cell's alignment is defined by the macro's second (tt(alignment))
specification, containing at most two alignment specifications: a horizontal
alignment (one of c, l, r (centered, left-aligned, right-aligned)) and a
vertical alignment (one of t, b (vertical top- and bottom-alignment)) (not all
conversion types may support all alignment types). Specifications other than
c, l, r, b, and t and specifications beyond the second one are ignored. The
result of specifying conflicting alignment types (e.g., tt(lr) or tt(tb)) is
not defined.

When converting to tt(man), if the table's contents should span multiple rows,
then a bf(groff/troff)(1) em(text block) must be used. Since most tables do
not use this, a text block is not generated by default. To actually wrap the
contents of column elements in a text block while converting to tt(man) prefix
the first text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(twrap(1)), and end
the last text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(wrap(0)).  Multiple
rows in a text block are top-aligned with left and righ neighboring cells.

The tt(tao) macro can be used to overrule the default alignment specification 
for a specific conversion type.

The macro tt(tnac) recognizes tt(attrib).
