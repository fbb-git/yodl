macro(includefile(file))
(Includes tt(file). The default
extension tt(.yo) is supplied if necessary.

Since Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion behavior has
changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at the
directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the directory
in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's file
inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates. The originally implemented file inclusion behavior is used when 
Yodl's tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used.
