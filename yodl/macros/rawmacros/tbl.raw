macro(tbl(align)(contents)) 
 (The tt(tbl) macro refines the more basic tt(table) macro. It was named after
the bf(tbl)(1) table formatting program used with bf(troff)(1) documents.

The tt(tbl) macro currently is available for tt(html, man/ms, latex) and
tt(txt) conversions.

Its first argument defines the alignment of the information in the table's
columns, and is used by all conversions except for tt(txt). Use tt(l) for
left-alignment, tt(c) for centered-alignment and tt(r) for
right-alignment. Individual cells of the table may override these default
settings using the macros tt(tac) and tt(tnac).

Its second argument defines the contents of the table consisting of rows
(using tt(tr)), and horizontal lines (using tt(tline)), which may extend over
the full table width or may cover one or more individual columns. With tt(txt)
conversion rough approximations of horizontal lines are used.

Tables defined by the tt(tbl) macro are centered (pseudo centering (8 space
characters) is used for tt(txt) conversion) when used as argument of the
tt(center) macro.
