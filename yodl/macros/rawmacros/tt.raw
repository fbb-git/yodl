macro(tt(text))
    (Sets tt(text) in teletype font, and prevents it from being expanded.
When converting to man, tt(text) is surrounded by a backtick and a single
quote character.

For unbalanced parameter lists, use tt(CHAR(C)HAR(40)) to get
tt(CHAR(40)) and tt(CHAR(C)HAR(41)) to get tt(CHAR(41)).

    The tt(tt) macro does interpret character tables as well as any tt(SUBST)
definitions. This is usually what is intended. In situations where this is
unwelcome the tt(ttbegin) and tt(ttend) pair of macros can be used, between
which the builtin commands tt(PUSHSUBST, POPSUBST, NOEXPAND) and/or
tt(NOTRANS) can be used. E.g., to clearly show two hyphens in LaTeX() 
teletype font use 
    verb(
    ttbegin()--ttend()
    )
rather than
    verb(
    tt(--)
    )
    Likewise, use tt(ttbegin) and tt(ttend) if the teletype text contains
accented letters like \"e. To set this in teletype font use 
tt(ttbegin()\")tt(e+ttend()).

With html conversions the tt(attrib) macro applies to the tt(<code>) tag.

With man conversions the arguments of tt macros can be quoted. See the
tt(manttquoted) macro for details.
