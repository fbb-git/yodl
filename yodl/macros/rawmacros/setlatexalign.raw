macro(setlatexalign(alignment)) 
 (This macro defines the table alignment used when setting tables in LaTeX().
Use as many tt(l) (for left-alignment), tt(r) (for right alignment), and tt(c)
(for centered-alignment) characters as there are columns in the table. See
also tt(table()).

Instead of using the tt(table) macro consider using the tt(tbl) macro.
