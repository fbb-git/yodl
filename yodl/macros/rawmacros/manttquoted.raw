macro(manttquoted(onOff)) 
 (With man-conversions arguments of tt macros are displayed as normal text. To
enhance their visibility arguments of tt macros may be quoted, in which case
they are surrounded by backtics and normal quotes. By default arguments of tt
macros are not quoted. Quotation is used after calling tt(manttquoted(1)), and
is suppressed after calling tt(manttquoted(0)). The macro is only active when
converting to man.
