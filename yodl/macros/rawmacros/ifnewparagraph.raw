macro(ifnewparagraph(truelist)(falselist))
 (The macro tt(ifnewparagraph) should be called from the tt(PARAGRAPH) macro,
if defined. It will insert tt(truelist) if a new paragraph is inserted,
otherwise tt(falselist) is inserted (e.g., following two consecutive calls of
PARAGRAPH). This macro can be used to prevent outputting multiple blank lines.
