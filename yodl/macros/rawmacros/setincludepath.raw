macro(setincludepath(name)) 
(Sets a new value of the include-path specification used when opening .yo
files. A warning is issued when the path specification does not include a .:
element. Note that the local directory may still be an element of the new
include path, as the local directory may be the only or the last element of
the specification. For these eventualities the new path specification is not
checked.)
