macro(tnc(nCells)(contents)) 
 (This macro is one of the four macros that can be used to define the column
contents of the rows of tables that are defined by the tt(tbl)
macro. Alternatively, tt(tc, tac), and tt(tnac) can be used.

The tt(tnc) macro is used as argument to the tt(tr) macro. Its first argument
defines the number of columns spanned by the contents (2nd argument) 
of the tt(tnc) macro. The contents are centered in the tt(nCells) columns.

When converting to tt(man), if the table's contents should span multiple rows,
then a bf(groff/troff)(1) em(text block) must be used. Since most tables do
not use this, a text block is not generated by default. To actually wrap the
contents of column elements in a text block while converting to tt(man) prefix
the first text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(twrap(1)), and end
the last text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(wrap(0)).  Multiple
rows in a text block are top-aligned with left and righ neighboring cells.

The macro tt(tc) recognizes tt(attrib).
