macro(setmanalign(alignment)) 
 (This macro defines the table alignment in the context of the tt(table)
macro, and is used when setting tables in man-pages (see bf(tbl)(1)).

Use as many tt(l) (for left-alignment), tt(r) (for right alignment), and tt(c)
(for centered-alignment) characters as there are columns in the
table. 

Use tt(s) to indicate that the column to its left is combined (spans into) the
current column. Use this specification when cells spanning multiple columns
must be defined. 

Each row in a table which must be convertible to a manpage may be preceded by
its own tt(setmanalign) call.  

Note that neither tt(rowline) nor tt(columnline) requires tt(setmanalign)
specifications, as these macros define rows by themselves. It is the
responsibility of the author to ensure that the number of alignment characters
is equal to the number of columns of the table.

Instead of using the tt(table) macro consider using the tt(tbl) macro.
