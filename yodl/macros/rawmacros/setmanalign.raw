macro(setmanalign(alignment)) 
(This macro defines the table alignment used when setting tables used in
man-pages (see bf(tbl)(1)).  Use as many tt(l) (for left-alignment), tt(r)
(for right alignment), and tt(c) (for centered-alignment) characters as there
are columns in the table. Furthermore, tt(s) can be used to indicate that the
column to its left is combined (spans into) the current column. Use this
specification when cells spanning multiple columns are defined. Each row in a
table which must be convertible to a manpage may contain a separate
tt(setmanalign()) call.  Note that neither tt(rowline) nor tt(columnline)
requires tt(setmanalign()) specifications, as these macros define rows by
themselves. It is the responsibility of the author to ensure that the number
of alignment characters is equal to the number of columns of the table.)
