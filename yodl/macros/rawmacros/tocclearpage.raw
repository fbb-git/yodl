macro(tocclearpage())
 (With the LaTeX() converter, a tt(clearpage()) directive if inserted,
immediately following the document's table of contents. This is already the
default in all but the tt(article) document type, but it can be overruled by
tt(notocclearpage()). When present, it must appear in the em(preamble); i.e.,
before the document type is stated with tt(article), tt(book) or
tt(report). With other converters than the LaTeX() converter, it is ignored.)
