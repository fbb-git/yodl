macro(tao(type)(specification))
 (This macro is used inside the tt(tbl) macro to override the alignment
specification that would otherwise be used for the next table element. It is
only active for the next tt(tc, tnc, tac,) or tt(tnac) call. Its first
argument defines the conversion type for which the override should be used,
its second argument defines the alignment specification to use.


Here are some examples:
        verb(
    tbl(lr)(
        tr(
            tc(left aligned)
            tc(right aligned)
        )
        tr(
            tao(html)(c)tc(left aligned, except with html: then centered)
            tao(latex)(l)tao(man)(l)
                tac(c)(centered, except for latex and man: then left aligned)
        )
    )
        )

Further details about the tt(tao) macro are provided in the bf(yodltables)(7)
man-page.
