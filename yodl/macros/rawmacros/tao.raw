macro(tao(type)(specification) 
 (This macro is used inside the tt(tbl) macro to override the alignment
specification that would otherwise be used for the next table element. It is
only active for the next tt(tc, tnc, tac,) or tt(tnac) call. Its first
argument defines the conversion type for which the override should be used,
its second argument defines the alignment specification to use.


Here are some examples:
        verb(
    tbl(lr)(
        tr(
            tc(left aligned)
            tc(right aligned)
        )
        tr(
            tao(html)(c)tc(left aligned, except with html: then centered)
            tao(latex)(l)tao(man)(l)
                tac(c)(centered, except for latex and man: then left aligned)
        )
    )
        )

it() Details when converting to html:

The tt(t) and tt(b) specifications can be used to respectively top- and
bottom-align cells in a table row. Usually tt(tao) doesn't have to be used, as
tt(tac) already provides facilities for aligning cell contents. E.g., 
tt(tac(cb)(...)) centers the contents, and aligns its bottom line with the
remaining cells on its line.

it() Details when converting to LaTeX():
    quote(
To request a top-aligned table element of a specified width (e.g., 4 cm.) the
following tt(tao) specification can be used:
        verb(
    tao(latex)(NOTRANS(t{p{4cm}}))
        )
    Similarly, for a center-aligned element use tt(c{p{4cm}}). But to align
the bottom-line of a multi-line element with its neighboring cells use
        verb(
    tao(latex)(NOTRANS(b{b{4cm}}))
        )
(a combination is also possible: if one cell uses top alignment, and another
bottom alignment, then the top line of the former cell and the bottom line of
the latter cell are on the same physical line).

Alternatively, instead of using fixed widths explicit newlines can be used. In
that case, a specification like tt(tao(latex)(rb)) will align its bottom line
with the other cells in its row, while right-aligning its contents.

When a fixed width is specified for a cell, then other cells in its column not
automatically also use that width. If other cells should also use a fixed
width they must explicitly specify their widths.
