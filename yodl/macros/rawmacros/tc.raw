macro(tc(contents)) 
 (This macro is one of the four macros that can be used to define the column
contents of the rows of tables that are defined by the tt(tbl)
macro. Alternatively, tt(tnc, tac), and tt(tnac) can be used.

The tt(tc) macro is used as argument of the tt(tr) macro. Its order within a
row defines its type attribute, using the alignment specification defined by
the first argument of the tt(tbl) call. E.g., if tt(tbl(clr)(...)) was used,
then the contents of the first tt(tc) call in a tt(tr) is centered in the
table's first column; the contents of the second tt(tc) call is left-aligned
in the table's second column; and the contents of the third tt(tc) call is
right-aligned in the table's third column.

When converting to tt(man), if the table's contents should span multiple rows,
then a bf(groff/troff)(1) em(text block) must be used. Since most tables do
not use this, a text block is not generated by default. To actually wrap the
contents of column elements in a text block while converting to tt(man) prefix
the first text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(twrap(1)), and end
the last text block requiring a text-block wrapping by tt(wrap(0)).

The macro tt(tc) recognizes tt(attrib).
