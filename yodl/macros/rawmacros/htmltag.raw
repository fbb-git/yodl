macro(htmltag(tagname)(start))
 (Sets tt(tagname) as a HTML tag, enclosed by tt(<) and tt(>). When tt(start)
is zero, the tt(tagname) is prefixed with tt(/). As not all html tags are
available through predefined Yodl-macros (there are too many of them, some are
used very infrequently, and you can easily define macros for the tags for
which Yodl doesn't offer predefined ones), the tt(htmltag) macro can be used
to handle your own set of macros. In html the tt(attrib) macro is
supported. E.g.,
    verb(
attrib(title="World Health Organization")CHAR(\)
    htmltag(abbr)()WHO+htmltag(abbr)(0)
    )
 )
