macro(attrib(text))
    (In html, pushes tt(text) as an attribute for the next html tag supporting
tt(attrib).  E.g, to
set a blue color and 30 pixel left-hand side margin for a section use
    verb(
    attrib(style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;")\ 
    sect(Section name)
    ) 
    This results
in the html markup+nl()
    verb(
    <h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">Section name</h1>
    )
    This macro is only effective with html conversions. It is applied in a
stack-wise fasion: when multiple tt(attrib) calls are used, then the topmost
attrib-string is added to the first macro calling the 
tt(attribinsert) macro, with subsequent macros using subsequent elements on
the attrib-stack. 

Commonly used attributes are tt(id="idname"), expecting a tt(#idname) CSS
label in either internal or external CSS specifications, or tt(style="spec")
(as shown in the example). 

Example: when using
    verb(
    attrib(width = "100" height = "100")
    attrib(id = "#fig")
    figure(imgfile)(Caption)(IMG)
    )
    then the tt(#id) attribute is applied to tt(<figure>), and the tt(width)
and tt(height) attributes are applied to tt(<img>), which html markup is
inserted by the tt(figure) macro.


 The tt(attrib) macro is supported by the following predefined macros (between
parentheses the number of attribute strings that are inserted by these macros;
if only 1 attribute string is inserted no number is shown):
