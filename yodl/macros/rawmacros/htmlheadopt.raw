macro(htmlheadopt(option)) 
 (Adds the literal text tt(option) to the current information in the tt(head)
section of an HTML document. tt(Option) may (or: should) contain plain html
text. A commonly occurring head option is tt(link), defining, e.g., a style
sheet. Since that option is frequently used, it has received a dedicated
macro: tt(htmlstylesheet). When large bodies of html-text must be added to
html documents the macro tt(htmlheadfile) should be used. This macro is only
active in the preamble and is only interpreted for html conversions.
