COMMENT(
    XXonlyblanks is defined by Yodl to indicate that only blanks were 
    inserted since PARAGRAPH() was called. It can be used to prevent the 
    output of multiple blank lines.

    To prevent the calling of PARAGRAPH in a certain context, use
    PUSHMACRO(PARAGRAPH)(0)() at the begin of the context, and
    POPMACRO(PARAGRAPH) at the end of the context.

    Just before PARAGRAPH is called, the symbol XXparagraph is set to the
whitespace text that would have been inserted if PARAGRAPH wasn't
defined. This does not happen if XXparagraph is not defined. It is NOT defined
by default. 

    The ifonlyblanks()() macro can be used to distinguish between series of
PARAGRAPH() activations and the first time PARAGRAPH is called following other
output. 

    If PARAGRAPH() would be called from within PARAGRAPH() itself its literal
whitespace text is output at that point. No nested calls of PARAGRAPH will
occur from an automated call of PARAGRAPH. It is possible, however, to call
PARAGRAPH recursively yourself (at your own risk)
