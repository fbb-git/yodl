macro(verbinsert(args))
    (Passes tt(args) to bf(yodlverbinsert)(1), inserting its output into the
converted file. This macro can be used to insert, e.g., a line-numbered
indented file, or a labeled subsection of a file, into the file that's
currently being written by tt(yodl). E.g,
    verb(
    verbinsert(-ans4 file)          -- inserts file, showing line
                                       numbers, using a 4 blank-space
                                       character wide indentation.

    verbinsert(-ns4 //SECT file)    -- inserts the section of file, 
                                       labeled //SECT file, showing line
                                       numbers, using a 4 blank-space 
                                       character wide indentation.
