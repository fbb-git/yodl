macro(setrofftab(x))
 (Sets the character separating items in a line of input data of a tt(roff)
(manpage) table. By default it is set to tt(~). This separator is used
internally, and needs only be changed (into some unique character) if the
table elements themselves contain tt(~) characters.

    This macro can be used in the context of the tt(table) and tt(tbl) macros.
