Creating the macros
-------------------

Macros for the man- and manual-pages are different from the macros that will
eventually be stored in, e.g., /usr/share/yodl. The former use the macros
defined in tmp/wip, the latter the macros in tmp/install/$STD_INCLUDE. The
macros under tmp/install are installed by 'build install macros'.

STD_INCLUDE is determined from tmp/wip/config.h, which is created in 'build',
and becomes available after 'build programs'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script 'scripts/configreplacements' replaces the #defined variables in
tmp/wip/config.h by their values in various .in files. The configreplacements
script requires three arguments:

    - the .in file to be processed
    - the .yo file to create
    - the path to the macro files. This is either STD_INCLUDE for the
      distribution macros or tmp/wip/macros when constructing the manual or
      man-pages 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script 'scripts/stdmacros' creates the std.<format>.yo macro files. It
requires four arguments:

    - an intermediate filename (g_wip/scratch)
    - the directory to write the std file into (either tmp/install/... or 
        tmp/wip/...)
    - the <format> to use in std.<format>.yo (this is one of the standard
        formats defined in 'build' at STD_CONVERSIONS
    - the appropriate STD_INCLUDE to use. This is either STD_INCLUDE as
        defined in INSTALL.im or it is "./", which is used for the man and
        manual construction.


The macros for the man- and manual-pages are created under tmp/wip/macros, and
the list of macros is written to tmp/macrolist.yo

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'build man' creates the man pages and associated macros in tmp/wip/macros

The man-pages are stored under tmp/install/usr/share/man

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'build manual' creates the manual.  Once defined, the following stamp-files
prevent recreating them:

    tmp/man-macros-stamp    - the macros for the man(ual) were built
    tmp/macrolist-stamp     - the documentation of the raw macros was written
                              to tmp/wip/macrolist.yo
    tmp/html-manual-stamp   - the manual in html format was successfully built
    tmp/latex-manual-stamp  - the manual in LaTeX format was successfully
                              built 
    tmp/txt-manual-stamp    - the manual in txt format was successfully built

The manual in various formats in stored in tmp/install/usr/share/doc/yodl-doc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'build macros' creates the macro files in tmp/install/usr/share/yodl. These
macro files are part of the distribution. Once defined, reconstructing them is
prevented by the stamp file:

    tmp/macros-stamp        - macros for $STD_INCLUDE were built
