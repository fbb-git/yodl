Manual pages can be constructed using the special tt(yodl2man) converter.
This converter assumes that the manual page has been designed using the
tt(manpage()) macro. Yodl (and thus the tt(yodl2man) converter, when conerting
man-pages, will skip all leading white space on lines. Paragraphs are
supported, though. An empty line separates paragraphs.
