The XML converter is experimental. It was added to YODL to allow me to write
documents for the horrible `webplatform' of the university of Groningen. The
XML support files (located in the tt(xml) directory in the standard macro's
directory) clearly reflect this target. Although experimental, they were kept
because the XML macros support interesting constructions allowing YODL to
handle closing tags somewhat more strict than required for HTML.
