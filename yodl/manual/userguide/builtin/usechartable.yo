tt(USECHARTABLE) takes one parameter list: the name of a translation
table to activate. The table must previously have been defined using
tt(DEFINECHARTABLE). See section ref(CHARTABLES) for a description of
character translation tables.

Alternatively, the name may be empty in which case the default character
mapping is restored.
