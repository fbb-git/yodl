tt(OUTDIR) inserts the current path name of the output file into the output
file. The path name is a, not necessarily absolute, designator of the
directory in which the output file is located. If the output file is indicated
as, e.g., tt(-o out), then tt(OUTDIR) simply inserts a dot.

If the output file is the standard output file, a dot is inserted too.
