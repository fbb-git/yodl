The tt(ADDTOCOUNTER) function adds a given value to a counter. It expects two
parameter lists: the counter name, and the value to add. The counter must be
previously created with tt(DEFINECOUNTER).

The value to add can be negative; in that case, a value is of course
subtracted from the counter.

See further section ref(COUNTERS).
