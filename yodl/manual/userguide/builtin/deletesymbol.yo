tt(DELETESYMBOL) removes the definition of a symbol variable. It
expects one parameter list, holding the name of the variable to deleted.

This macro has no error condition (except for syntax errors): the symbol in
question may be previously defined, but that is not necessary.

    Example:
        verb(
    DELETESYMBOL(Options)
        )
