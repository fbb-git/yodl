tt(STRLEN) expects one arguments. It returns the length of the text
that's provided as tt(STRLEN's) first argument. Instead of plain text the name
of a symbol may be specified as tt(STRLEN's) first argument, in which case
the length of that symbol's textual value is returned.

E.g., 
        verb(
    STRLEN(Hello)
        ) 
returns 5.
