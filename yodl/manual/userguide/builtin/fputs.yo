The function tt(FPUTS) expects two arguments: the first argument is
information to be appended to a file, whose name is given as the second
argument. The first argument is processed by Yodl before it is appended to the
requested filename, so it may contain macro calls.

    For example, the following statement appends a countervalue to the
mentioned file:
        verb(
    FPUTS(There have been COUNTERVALUE(attempts) attempts)(/tmp/logfile)
        )
    The second argument (name of the file) is not evaluated, but is used as
received.
