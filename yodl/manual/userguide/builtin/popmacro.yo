tt(POPMACRO) is used to remove the actual macro definition, restoring a
previously pushed definition.
The values of macros may be pushed on a stack using
link(PUSHMACRO)(PUSHMACRO). To remove the topmost element of a macro's
stack tt(POPMACRO) is available. tt(POPMACRO) expects one argument: the
name of the macro to pop. The previously pushed value then becomes the new
value of the macro. 

A macro's value may be popped after defining it, whereafter the stack will be
empty, but the macro will still be defined. In that case, using the macro
is considered an error.

    Example:
        verb(
    DEFINEMACRO(Hello)(1)(Hello, ARG1, this is a macro definition)
    Hello(Karel)
    PUSHMACRO(Hello)(1)(Hello, ARG1, this is the new definition)
    Hello(Karel)
    POPMACRO(Hello)
    Hello(Karel)
    COMMENT(The third activation of Hello() produces the same output
            as the first activation)
        )
