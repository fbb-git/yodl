tt(IFSMALLER) expects four argument lists. It tests whether its
first argument is smaller to its second argument. If so, the third parameter
list is evaluated, else, the fourth parameter list is evaluated. All four
argument lists must be present, though all can be empty lists.

    The first two arguments of tt(IFSMALLER) should be integral 
numerical arguments. In order to determine whether the first two arguments are 
equal, their values are determined:
    itemization(
    it() If the argument starts with an integral numerical value, that value
is the value of the argument.
    it() If the argument is the name of a counter, the counter's value is the
value of the argument
    it() If the values of the first two arguments van be determined
accordingly, their order relation will determine whether the true list (when
the first value is smaller than the second value) or the false list (when the
first value is greater than or equal to the second value) will be evaluated.
    it() Otherwise, tt(IFSMALLER) will evaluate the false list.
    )

    Example:
        verb(
    IFSMALLER(counter)(5)(\ 
        counter is smaller than the value 5, or counter is no Yodl-counter
    )(\ 
        counter exceeds the value 5
    )
        )
    Please note the preferred layout: The first argument immediately follows
the function name, then the second argument (the em(true list)) is indented,
as is the em(false list). The layout closely follows the preferred layout of
tt(if-else) statements of many programming languages.
