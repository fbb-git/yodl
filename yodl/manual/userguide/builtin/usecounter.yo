tt(USECOUNTER) is a combination of tt(ADDTOCOUNTER) and
tt(COUNTERVALUE). It expects one parameter list: the name of an defined 
counter (see lref(DEFINECOUNTER)(DEFINECOUNTER)).

The counter is first incremented by 1. Then the function expands to 
the counter's value.

See also section ref(COUNTERS).
