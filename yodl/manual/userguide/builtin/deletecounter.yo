tt(DELETECOUNTER) removes a definition of a counter that
was defined by tt(DEFINECOUNTER). This function expects one argument: the
name of the counter to remove.

If the counter does not exist, a warning is issued. It is not considered an
error to try to delete a counter that has not been defined earlier.

    Example:
        verb(
    DELETECOUNTER(mycounter)
        )
