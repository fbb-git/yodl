A defined translation table is activated by the macro tt(USECHARTABLE). This
macro takes one parameter list, which may be:

itemization(

    it() empty, in which case the default mapping is restored,
    
    it() a name of a previously defined character table.
    
)

The default mapping, selected when an empty parameter list is given, means 
that Yodl enters its `zero translation state', meaning no character translation 
at all.
