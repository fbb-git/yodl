A defined translation table is activated by the macro tt(USECHARTABLE). This
macro takes one argument, which may be:

itemization(
    it() empty, in which case the default mapping is restored,
    it() a name of a previously defined character table.
)

The default mapping, selected when an empty argument is given, means that Yodl
enters its `zero translation state', meaning no character translation at all.
