The builtin function tt(PIPETHROUGH) is, besides tt(SYSTEM), the second
function with which a Yodl document can affect its
environment. tt(PIPETHROUGH) can be very useful. It uses an external program
to accomplish special features. The idea is that an external command is
started, to which a block of text from within a Yodl document is `piped'. The
output of that child program is piped back into the Yodl document; hence, a
block of text is `piped through' an external program.  Whatever is received
again in the Yodl run, is further processed.

The tt(PIPETHROUGH) function takes two arguments:

itemization(

    it() the command to run, and

    it() the text to send to that command.

)

Functionally, the occurrence of the tt(PIPETHROUGH) function and of its two
arguments is replaced by whatever the child program produces on its standard
output. 

An example might be the inclusion of the current date, as in:

verb(The current date is:
PIPETHROUGH(date)())

In this example the command is tt(date) and the text to send to that program is
empty.

The main purpose of this function is to provide a way by which external programs
can be used to create, e.g., tables or figures for a given output format.
Further releases of Yodl may contain such dedicated programs for the output
formats.
