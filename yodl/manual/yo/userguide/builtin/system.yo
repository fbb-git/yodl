tt(SYSTEM) takes one argument: a command to execute. The command is run via
the standard C function tt(system). 

tt(SYSTEM) can be useful in many ways. E.g., you might want to log when
someone processes your document, as in:
        verb(
    SYSTEM(echo Document processed! | mail myself@my.host)
        )
    Note that tt(SYSTEM) merely performs an system-related task. It's a
process that is separated from the YODL process itself. One of the
consequences of this is that any output generated by tt(SYSTEM) will not
normally appear into YODL's output file. If the output of a subprocess should
be inserted into YODL's output file, either use
lref(PIPETHROUGH)(PIPETHROUGH), or insert a temporary file as shown in the
following example:
        verb(
    SYSTEM(date > datefile)
    The current date is: 
    INCLUDEFILE(datefile)
    SYSTEM(rm datefile)
        )
