    As distributed, Yodl supports four document types: em(article, report,
book) and the em(manual) page. Note that document types are essentially
unrelated to output formats; a book can be converted to each of the output
formats, and a manual page can be converted to a tt(.html) file. Nevertheless,
some formats are particularly usefule for some document types. A book
converted to the tt(man) output format to be processed later with tt(groff)
won't look too good. Its looks would greatly improve when the document would
be converted to ASCII using the tt(ms) output format.

Following the preamble and the definition of specialized macros symbols and
counters, documents start by specifying the document type.  The available
macros are:
    itemization(
    it() tt(article(title)(author)(date)): The tt(article) document type
should be used for short documents. Its arguments specify the document's
title, author and date.
    
    In articles, the title page is numbered and the table of contents is on
the title page. The sectioning commands tt(sect), tt(subsect) etc.  are
available.
    it() tt(report(title)(author)(date)): The tt(report) document type differs
from an tt(article) in that it has a separate unnumbered title page, a table
of contents on a page of its own, and it supports the sectioning command
tt(chapter) in addition to the ones supported by tt(article)s. A tt(report)
should be used fir larger documents.
    it() tt(book(title)(author)(date)): The tt(book) type is for even larger
documents. In addition to the sectioning commands supported by tt(report) it
supports the sectioning command tt(part).
    it() tt(plainhtml(title)): This document type is typically used in HTML
output. It's implemented for situations where you only need to create a HTML
file, but want to use Yodl to help you by providing useful macros.  This
document type is similar to tt(article), but does not require you to specify
tt(author) and tt(date) arguments (In fact, you can emulate tt(plainhtml) by
using an tt(article), using empty author and date arguments).
    it() tt(manpage(title)(section)(date)(source)(manual)): The tt(manpage)
document type should only be used to write Unix-style manual pages. It uses
its own sectioning commands to reflect the necessary sections in a manual
page. This document format is described separately in ref(MANPAGE).
    )
    These macros provide, globally, three functions: First, the macros
generate any commands that need to appear before `real' text is sent to the
output file.  E.g., the LaTeX output needs a tt(\documentstyle)
preamble, HTML output needs tt(<html>) and tt(<body>) tags.

Second, the macros define appropriate document-dependent settings. E.g., the
LaTeX converter defines the title, author and date using tt(\title) etc..

Third, the actual document is started. E.g., for LaTeX this means a
tt(\begin{)em(type)tt(}), followed by the appropriate commands to generate a
the document title and the table of contents.  The tt(title) setting in the
above macros defines the document title which always appears on the front page
of the document. For HTML output, this is also the title of the HTML file (or
files), as appearing in the HTML tt(<title>) tag.

The fact that the macros defining the document type perform many functions
means that once the macro is started, nothing `extra' can be inserted between,
e.g., the generated title and the table of contents. Sometimes this is not
what you'd like; as is the case with an abstract. Yodl therefore uses
em(modifiers), appearing em(before) the document type macros, to insert
information between the various elements of a document definition.
