This section describes the organization of the source files. Its contents are
not necessarily relevant for the binary distribution. The section is probably
most useful to those readers who want to be able to extend or who want to do
maintenance on YODL's sources, or who want simply to understand what's
happening inside the YODL program. 

Much of the documentation is provided in the individual source files
themselves. This section, however, should offer the `broad picture', allowing
you to understand the logic behind YODL relatively fast.
