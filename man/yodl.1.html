<p>
<h2 >NAME</h2>yodl - main Yodl converter
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
<strong >yodl</strong> [OPTION]... [FILE]...
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and
tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document
in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. <strong >yodl2html</strong>(1)) to convert it
to some final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, 
man, LaTeX, text and an experimental xml converter.  Main
document types are "article", "report", "book" "manpage" and "letter".  The
Yodl document language is designed to be easy to use and extensible.
<p>
<strong >NOTE:</strong> Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way <strong >C</strong>'s <code >#include</code> directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if the
<code >-L</code> (<code >--legacy-include</code>) option is used (see below).
<p>
<h2 >OPTIONS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <code >-D, --define=NAME[=VALUE]</code>: Defines <em >name</em> as a symbol. This
option is acts like <code >DEFINESYMBOL(NAME)()</code>. If <code >=VALUE</code> is added, <code >NAME</code>
is initialized to <code >VALUE</code> (identically to <code >DEFINESYMBOL(NAME)(VALUE)</code>).
    <li> <code >-d, --definemacro=NAME=EXPANSION</code>: Defines <code >NAME</code> as macro
expanding to <code >EXPANSION</code>
    <li> <code >-h, --help</code>: usage information is written to the standard error
stream, describing all of Yodl's options.
    <li> <code >-i, --index[=file]</code>: `file' is the name of the index file. By
default <code >&lt;outputbase&gt;.idx</code> is used. No default when output is written to
stdout. The index file is processed by Yodl's post-processor, <code >yodlpost</code>.
    <li> <code >-I, --include=DIR</code>: This defines the system-wide include directory
where YODL searches for its input files. E.g. a statement to include a
given file, like:
        <pre>
INCLUDEFILE(latex)
</pre>

    Yodl now searches for the file <code >latex</code> in the current directory,
and when that fails, in the system-wide include directory. The system-wide
include directory is typically the place where the maintainer of a system
stores macro-files for Yodl. This searching process applies to files that are
included inside a document but also applies to filenames on the command line
when invoking the YODL program.
<p>
The name of the included file (<code >latex</code> in the above example) is the bare
name, YODL supplies a default extension (<code >.yo</code>), if necessary. 
<p>
The <code >-I</code> option overrules Yodl's built-in name for the system-wide
include directory. The built-in name is defined when compiling Yodl, and is,
e.g., <code >/usr/share/yodl</code>. Furthermore, the definition may contain $HOME,
which is replaced by the user's home directory if the `home' or `HOME'
environment variable is defined. It may also contain $STD_INCLUDE, which 
is replaced by the compilation defined standard include path. The standard
includepath may be overruled by either (in that order) the command line switch
<code >-I</code> or the <code >YODL_INCLUDE_PATH</code> environment variable. By default, the
current directory is added to the standard include path. Hewver, when <code >-I</code>
or <code >YODL_INCLUDE_PATH</code> is used, the current directory must be mentioned
explicitly.  The individual directories need not be terminated by a
/-character.  In distributed <code >.deb</code> archives, the standard directory is
defined as <code >/usr/share/yodl</code> (prefixed by the current working directory).
   <li> <code >-k, --keep-ws</code>: Since YODL version 2.00 blanks at the begin and end
of lines are ignored, even without a trailing \, when the `white space level'
is non-zero. Earlier versions kept these blanks. The legacy handling of white
space at end of lines can by obtained using the <code >-k</code> flag. Note that white
space are always kept when using verbatim copying, and when the white-space
level is zero.
    <li> <code >-m, --messages=SET</code>: Set the so-called `message level' 
to a combination of the SET <code >acdeinw</code>. The letters of this set have the
following meanings:
    <ul>
    <li> <code >a</code>: alert. When an alert-error occurs, Yodl terminates. Here Yodl
requests something of the system (like a <code >get_cwd()</code>), but the system fails.
    <li> <code >c</code>: critical. When a critical error occurs, Yodl terminates.  The
message itself can be suppressed, but exiting can't. A critical condition is,
e.g., the omission of an open parenthesis at a location where a parameter list
should appear, or a non-existing file in an <code >INCLUDEFILE</code> specification (as
this file should be parsed). A non-existing file with a <code >NOEXPANDINCLUDE</code>
specification is a plain (non-critical) error.
    <li> <code >d</code>: debug. Probably too much info, like getting information about 
each character that was read by Yodl.
    <li> <code >e</code>: error. An error (like doubly defined symbols). Once an error
has been encountered the remainder of the input is still parsed (up to a
maximum number of errors), but no output is generated.
    <li> <code >i</code>: info. Not as detailed as `debug', but still very much info,
like information about media switches.
    <li> <code >n</code>: notice. Information about, e.g., calls to the builtin
function calls.
    <li> <code >w</code>: warning. Something you should know about, but probably not
affecting Yodl's proper functioning
    </ul>
    Non-configurable is the handling of an <em >emergency</em> message. These
messages can't be suppressed, but shouldn't happen, as they point to some
internal error. It would be appreciated to 
        <a href="mailto:f.b.brokken@rug.nl">receive information</a> 
    about these messages if they ever occur.
    <li> <code >-n, --max-nested-files=NR</code>: This option causes Yodl to abort when
the number of nested input files exceeds <code >NR</code>, which is 20 by
default. Exceeding this number usually means a circular definition somewhere
in the document. This is the case when, a file <code >a.yo</code> includes <code >b.yo</code>,
while <code >b.yo</code> includes <code >a.yo</code> etc.. It does not prevent recursive macro- or
subst-replacements. For that the <code >-r</code> (<code >--max-replacements</code>) option is
available.
    <li> <code >-o, --output=FILE</code>: This option causes Yodl to write its output to
<code >FILE</code>. By default, the output goes to the standard output stream. E.g.,
you can use YODL to read a file <code >input</code> and to write to
<code >output</code> with the following two commands:
    <pre>

        yodl input &gt; output
        yodl -ooutput input
    
</pre>

    The difference being that in the latter case an index file is generated,
but not in the former case. Notice that writing an index file can be forced
when the <code >--index</code> option is specified.
    <li> <code >-p, --preload=CMD</code>: This option `pre-loads' the string <code >cmd</code>. It
acts as though <code >cmd</code> was the first command in the first input file that is
processed by YODL.
<p>
More than one <code >--preload=CMD</code> options may be present on the command
line.  Each of the commands is then processed in turn, before reading 
any file.
    <li> <code >-r, --max-replacements=NR</code>: This option causes Yodl to abort when
the number of macro calls or subst-replacements exceeds <code >NR * 10,000</code>. 
By default, <code >NR</code> equals 1. Setting <code >--max-replacements=0</code> implies that 
no macro- or subst-replacement checks are performed.
    <li> <code >-t, --trace</code>: This option enables tracing: while parsing, Yodl
writes its output to the standard error stream. As is the case with the <code >-k</code>
option, this option is defined for debugging purposes only.
    <li> <code >-V, --version</code>. This option shows YODL's actual version.
    <li> <code >-v, --verbose</code>: This option increases Yodl's `verbosity level' and
may occur more than once. By default yodl shows alerting, critical,
emergency and error messages. Each <code >--verbose</code> option adds a next
message level. In order, warning, notice, info and debug messages are
added to this set. It is also possible to suppress messages. The
<code >VERBOSITY</code> builtin can be used for that.
    <li> <code >-W, --warranty</code>. This option shows a warranty disclaimer and a
copyright notice. 
    <li> <code >-w, --warn</code>: The presence of this option caused Yodl to warn when,
e.g., symbols are redefined.
</ul>

<h2 >FILES</h2>
<p>
The <strong >yodl</strong> program requires no files, but `normal' usage of the Yodl
    package requires macro files, by default installed in
    <code >tmp/wip/macros</code>. The
    files in this directory are included by the converters <strong >yodl2txt</strong>(1)
    etc..
