<p>
<h2 >NAME</h2>yodltables - Yodl's table support
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
Tables are preferably defined using the <code >tbl</code> macro, although the
    <code >table</code> macro remains available. The macros that are used in combination
    with <code >tbl</code> are described in this man-page and also in the
    <strong >yodlmacros</strong>(7) man-page. The macros that are used in combination with
    the <code >table</code> macros are described in the <strong >yodlmacros</strong>(7) man-page only.
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
<ul> 
    <li> To start a table the <code >tbl</code> macro is used. It is currently available
        for <code >html, man/ms, latex</code> and <code >txt</code> conversions. When specifying
        <code >tbl</code> as an argument of the <code >center</code> macro, the resulting table
        will be centered on the page or html screen. In text mode centering is
        simulated by starting each row with eight blank space characters.
<p>
Its first argument defines the alignment of the information in the
        table's columns, and is used by all conversions except <code >txt</code>. Use
        <code >l</code> for left-alignment, <code >c</code> for centered-alignment and <code >r</code> for
        right-alignment. Individual cells of the table may override these
        default settings using the macros <code >tac</code> and <code >tnac</code>.
<p>
Its second argument defines the contents of the table consisting of
        rows (using <code >tr</code>), and horizontal lines (using <code >tline</code>), which may
        extend over the full table width or may cover one or more individual
        columns. With <code >txt</code> conversion rough approximations of horizontal
        lines are used.
<p>
When defining tables it is advised to clearly layout the table
        specification. To avoid inadvertently introducing new lines lines
        should end in a backslash (or comment).
<p>
Example:
    
            <pre>

tbl(lcr)(\// 3 columns, resp. left, center and right aligned
    \// contents go here
)\ 
            
</pre>

<p>
The macro <code >tbl</code> recognizes <code >attrib</code>. 
<p>
<li> Rows of a table are defined by the <code >tr</code>-macro. It expects one
        argument: the contents of the row, defining the row's column elements.
        Instead of rows defining column elements (partial) horizontal
        lines may be inserted. The <code >tline</code> macro is used for that (see
        below). 
<p>
Example:
            <pre>

tbl(lcr)(\  
    tr(\//              1st row 
        \// row elements go here
    )\  
    tr(\//              2nd row
        \// row elements go here
    )\  
)\  
            
</pre>

<p>
The macro <code >tr</code> recognizes <code >attrib</code>. 
<p>
<li> Column elements are defined by the <code >tc, tn, tac,</code> and <code >tnac</code>
        macros. Each of these macros recognizes <code >attrib</code>.
<p>
<li> The <code >tc</code> macro defines the contents of column element: its order
        number in a row is aligned as specified by the corresponding letter in
        <code >tbl's</code> first argument. E.g.,
            <pre>

tbl(lcr)(\  
    tr(\  
       tc(left aligned)\  
       tc(centered)\  
       tc(right aligned)\  
    )\  
)\  
            
</pre>

<p>
<li> The <code >tnc</code> macro defines the contents of column element. It expects
        two arguments: the number of columns covered by this macro, and the
        contents of those elements. The contents are centered in the rows
        covered by the <code >tnc</code> macro. E.g., 
       <pre>

tbl(lcr)(\  
    tr(\  
       tc(left aligned)\  
       tnc(2)(centered)\//    spans columns 2 and 3.
    )\  
)\  
            
</pre>

<p>
<li> The <code >tac</code> macro defines the contents of column element, defining a
        specific alignment for its contents. It expects
        two arguments: the alignment to be used for this element and the
        element's contents. 
<p>
At most two alignment specification characters are used: a
        specification for the horizontal alignment (one of c, l, r (centered,
        left-aligned, right-aligned)) and a specification for the vertical
        alignment (one of t, b (vertical top- and bottom-alignment)) (not all
        conversion types may support all alignment types). Specifications
        other than c, l, r, b, and t are ignored. If only a vertical alignment
        type is specified, then usually the horizontal centered alignment is
        used. As a rule of thumb always also specify a horizontal alignment
        type if a vertical alignment type is specified. The result of
        specifying conflicting alignment types (e.g., <code >lr</code> or <code >tb</code>) is not
        defined.
<p>
Vertical alignment is handled differently by different conversion
        types. E.g., when table cells span multiple lines then LaTeX uses
        the vertical alignment specification for that cell to align the
        neighboring cells: with LaTeX conversions the following aligns
        <code >rows</code> and <code >second</code>:
       <pre>

tac(b)(two+nl()rows)
tc(second)
            
</pre>

       but with html-conversions <code >second</code> is vertically center-aligned: in
        between <code >two</code> and <code >rows</code>. Bottom line: provide each column element
        in a row that you want to be top- or bottom-aligned with a <code >t</code> or
        <code >b</code> specification.
<p>
When using man-conversions the situation is complex in that bottom
        alignment does not appear to be supported. Moreover, unless long lines
        are wrapped in `text blocks' (see below at <code >twrap</code>) there won't be
        any wrapping of long lines. The same holds true for LaTeX
        conversions, but with LaTeX columns may be given fixed physical
        widths, resulting in automatically wrapping long lines. Also, bottom
        alignment appears not to be supported when converting to man. At this
        point bottom alignment when converting to man is realized by defining
        a separate table row containing the last contents of a long line. This
        may require some iterations. The specification could then look
        somewhat like this (again: for <code >twrap</code> see below): 
    <pre>

tbl(lr)(\ 
    tr(\ 
        twrap(1)\ 
        tac(lb)(Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
                consectetur adipiscing elit, sed
                do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
                labore et dolore magna aliqua.)\ 
        twrap(0)\ 
        tc()\//           empty cell
    )\ 
    tr(\//                simulated bottom alignment, 
        tac(l)(Ut enim ad minim veniam)\ 
        tac(rb)(left)\ 
    )\ 
)\ 
            
</pre>

       In some cases (e.g., using LaTeX conversions where a column width
        must be specified) more elaborate alignment specifications are
        required. For that the <code >tao</code> (table alignment override) and
        <code >twrap</code> macros are available (see below).
<p>
E.g.,
            <pre>

tbl(lcr)(\ 
    tr(\ 
       tc(left aligned)\ 
       tac(l)(left aligned)\// left alignment instead 
                           \// of centered
       tac(rb)(left+nl()aligned)\// right-bottom
                           \// alignment
    )\ 
)\ 
            
</pre>

<p>
<li> The <code >tnac</code> macro defines the contents of column element, defining a
        specific alignment for its contents. It expects three arguments: the
        number of columns spanned by the contents of this macro, the alignment
        to be used and the element's contents.
<p>
The alignment specifications and considerations are the same as with
        the <code >tac</code> macro: see <code >tac's</code> description for the details.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >HORIZONTAL LINES</h2>
<p>
Horizontal lines (partially) spanning the width of tables defined by the
<code >tbl</code> macro are defined using the <code >tline</code> macro. The <code >tline</code> macro
expects two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li> If both arguments are specified, then the first argument defines the
        column <em >number</em> (so, not the column <em >offset</em>!) where a horizontal
        line must start, and the second argument defines the column number
        through where the horizontal line should continue. If a series of
        <code >tline</code> macros is specified then the first argument of the first
        <code >tline</code> macro call must be at least 1; the second argument of the
        last <code >tline</code> macro call must be at most equal to the table's number
        of columns. In addition the second arguments of <code >tline</code> calls must
        at least be equal to their first arguments, and the first arguments of
        subsequent <code >tline</code> calls must exceed the value of the second
        argument of the preceding <code >tline</code> macro call. A series of (at least
        one) <code >line</code> calls in which both arguments are specified must be
        followed by a <code >tline</code> call with two empty arguments. For example:
    <pre>

tbl(ccccc)(\ 
    tr(... row contents )\ 
    tline(1)(1)\//    horizontal line at column 1
    tline(3)(4)\//    horizontal line at columns 3 and 4
    tline()()\//      now defined.
    tr(... row contents )\ 
)\ 
    
</pre>

<p>
<li> Except for ending a series of <code >tline</code> calls in which both arguments
        are specified, a <code >tline</code> call not specifying its second argument
        sets a line over the full width of the table. In that case, when
        converting to txt a line of 60 minus (<code >-</code>) characters is written. If
        another number of minus characters is required then specify the
        required number as <code >tline's</code> first argument. When using other
        conversion types <code >tline's</code> first argument is ignored if its second
        argument is empty. Here is the previous example again, this time
        setting a horizontal line before and after the table's contents:
    <pre>

tbl(ccccc)(\ 
    tline()()\//      horizontal line spanning the full width
    tr(... row contents )\ 
    tline(1)(1)\//    horizontal line at column 1
    tline(3)(4)\//    horizontal line at columns 3 and 4
    tline()()\//      now defined.
    tr(... row contents )\ 
    tline()()\//      horizontal line spanning the full width
)\ 
    
</pre>

<p>
<h2 >SUPPORT MACROS</h2>
<p>
Two support macros are available: <code >twrap</code> for wrapping the contents of a
        cell in a `<em >text block</em>' when converting to man, and <code >tao</code> (table
        alignment override) for overriding a cell's alignment specification
        for a specific conversion type.
<p>
<strong >The twrap macro</strong>
<p>
The <code >twrap</code> macro is only interpreted when converting to man. It
        expects one numeric argument. If zero then the table's cells are used
        as specified; if non-zero then the table's cells are wrapped in
        groff/troff text blocks. 
<p>
If no text block is specified (i.e., <code >twrap(0)</code> (the default) is in
        effect) and a cell
        contains a long line the long line will continue on one physical line,
        disproportionally widening that cell's column; when using newlines are
        used in cell contents, and horizontal lines are used the resulting
        table may set the horizontal lines at unexpected rows. 
<p>
When requesting text blocks (i.e., <code >twrap(1)</code> was specified) long
        lines are automatically split up in lines of reasonable widths, and
        they will be left-aligned in their columns. Those long lines may also
        contain explicit newline macros, forcing new lines at user-defined
        positions. 
<p>
Once a <code >twrap</code> has been called, it remains in effect until the next
        <code >twrap</code> call is encountered.
<p>
<strong >The tao macro</strong>
<p>
The <code >tao</code> macro (table alignment override) is used to override the
        alignment specification that would otherwise be used for the next
        table element. It is only active for the next <code >tc, tnc, tac,</code> or
        <code >tnac</code> call. It expect two arguments: its first argument defines the
        conversion type for which the override should be used, its second
        argument defines the alignment specification to use.
<p>
Here are some examples:
    <pre>

tbl(lr)(\ 
    tr(\ 
        tc(left aligned)\ 
        tc(right aligned)\ 
    )\ 
    tr(\ 
        tao(html)(c)\ 
          tc(left aligned, except with html: then centered)\ 
        tao(latex)(l)tao(man)(l)\ 
          tac(c)(centered, but left aligned for latex and man)\ 
    )\ 
)
    
</pre>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> Details when converting to html:
       <blockquote > 
       The <code >t</code> and <code >b</code> specifications can be used to respectively top- and
        bottom-align cells in a table row. Usually <code >tao</code> doesn't have to be
        used, as the <code >tac</code> macro already provides facilities for aligning
        cell contents. E.g., <code >tac(cb)(...)</code> centers the contents, and aligns
        its bottom line with the remaining cells on its line.
       </blockquote>
<p>
<li> Details when converting to LaTeX:
       <blockquote >
       To request a top-aligned table element of a specified width (e.g., 4
        cm.) the following <code >tao</code> specification can be used:
       <pre>

tao(latex)(NOTRANS(t{p{4cm}}))
       
</pre>

       Similarly, for a center-aligned element use <code >c{p{4cm}}</code>. But to align
        the bottom-line of a multi-line element with its neighboring cells use
       <pre>

tao(latex)(NOTRANS(b{b{4cm}}))
       
</pre>

       (combinations are also possible: if one cell uses top alignment, and
        another bottom alignment, then the top line of the former cell and the
        bottom line of the latter cell appear on the same physical line).
<p>
Alternatively, instead of using fixed widths explicit newlines can be
        used. In that case, a specification like <code >tao(latex)(rb)</code> will align
        its bottom line with the other cells in its row, while right-aligning
        its contents.
<p>
When a fixed width is specified for a cell, then other cells in its
        column not automatically also use that width. If other cells should
        also use a fixed width they must explicitly specify their widths.
       </blockquote>
