manpagename(yodlmanpage)(Yodl's `manpage' document type)

manpagesynopsis()

    The bf(manpage) document type was specifically implemented to write
    Unix-style manual pages. Other Yodl document formats, such as bf(article),
    bf(report) and bf(book) are documented in the Yodl guide and in the
    manpage for bf(yodlmacros).

manpagedescription()

    This manual page briefly describes the bf(manpage) document type of the
    YOLD document language. This document type is specific enough that it
    warrants a separate manpage.

    bf(manpage) documents do not use the `standard' sectioning commands (e.g.,
    bf(sect)() and bf(subsect)()), but have specific bf(manpage...)() macros.
    You can however use (and are encouraged to..) other `normal' macros, such
    as bf(description)(...) or bf(itemization)(...) for lists, or bf(bf)() for
    boldface and bf(em)() for emphasis. As for fonts, the following is
    suggested:
        itemization(
        it() Use bf(em)(em(text)) when em(text) is a variable, or a
            placeholder, etc..
        it() Use bf(bf)(em(text)) when em(text) is literal, such as a command,
            a filename, a directory.
        )
    Each bf(manpage) document in Yodl must be organized as follows:

    itemization(
    it() bf(manpage)(em(name)) (em(section)) (em(date)) (em(package))
        (em(source)): This is the preamble of the document. It states whatever
        the page describes, the section where it belongs, the release date,
        the package that it belongs to, and the source of the package.
        The em(section) number should be (according to the Linux manpage on
        man): 1 for commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library calls, 4 for
        special files, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for macro packages
        and conventions, 8 for system management commands, and 9 for other
        special subjects (e.g., kernel commands).
    it() bf(manpagename)(em(name)) (em(short description)):  The em(name)
        is again whatever is described, the em(short description) is what
        e.g., the bf(whatis) database uses for descriptions.
    it() bf(manpagesynopsis)(): a very short `usage' information or
        similar.  Keep this section short, e.g., a line with all program
        options is acceptable but without descriptions (these come later).
    it() bf(manpagedescription)(): the purpose of the program and such.
        This is also the place to document the workings.
    it() bf(manpageoptions)(): This is the place to document e.g. the
        flags that are stated in the bf(manpagesynopsis)(). This section is 
        optional, but when present, must appear at this place.
    it() bf(manpagefiles)(): relevant files are described in this section.
    it() bf(manpageseealso)(): this section lists related manual pages.
    it() bf(manpagediagnostics)(): Error conditions, error messages, etc..
    it() bf(manpagebugs)(): This is where known bugs are described. This 
        section is optional.
    it() bf(manpageauthor)(): stating the author and/or the maintainer.
    it() bf(manpagesection)(em(NAME)): This macro starts a generic, 
        non-required section. E.g., you might want a 
        bf(manpagesection)bf((EXAMPLES)) in your document. As a typographic 
        suggestion, use upper case for the bf(NAME) argument for consistency 
        reasons.
