macro(table(nColumns)(alignment)(Contents)) 
(The tt(table())-macro defines a table. Its first argument specifies the
number of columns in the table.  Its second argument specifies the (standard)
alignment of the information within the cells as used by LaTeX() or
man/ms. Use tt(l) for left-alignment, tt(c) for centered-alignment and tt(r)
for right alignment. Its third argument defines the contents of
the table which are the rows, each containing column-specifications and
optionally man/ms alignment definitions for this row.

See also the specialized tt(setmanalign()) macro.
