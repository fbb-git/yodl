macro(XXmlEndBlock())
(XXmlEndBlock begins an x-htmlblock. 
The macro is active only in xml conversion mode, as it is not called in other 
modes.

Conversely, XXmlEndBlock ends an x-htmlblock and XXmlReduceBlock reduces
(possibly closes) an x-htmlblock. 

Opening a block is realized by XXmlBeginBlock:
    1. if no block is open, it is opened, and the XXblock counter is set to 1.
    2. if the block is open, an error is produced.

Closing a block using XXmlEndBlock is done as follows:
    1. if XXblock is not 1, an error is reported
    2. if XXblock is 1, it is reduced, and the end-block is inserted

Beginning Nesting blocks may be realized by XXmlIncBlock:
    1. if no block is open, an error is produced
    2. if XXblock is 1, the block is closed and immediately opened thereafter,
        setting XXblock to 2.
    3. if XXblock is at least 2, it is incremented

Closing Nesting blocks may be realized by XXmlDecBlock:
    1. if no block is open, an error is produced
    2. if XXblock is 2, the block is closed and immediately opened thereafter,
        setting XXblock to 1.
    3. if XXblock exceeds 2, it is decremented

In normal documents: 
    XXmlBeginBlock is called at the beginning, 
    XXmlEndBlock is called at the end.

    XXmlEndBlock and XXmlBeginblcok is called around figures

    XXmlIncBlock and XXmlDecBlock are called around tables.)
