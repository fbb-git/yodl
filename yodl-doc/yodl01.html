<h1 >Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<code >Yodl</code> stands for `Your Own Document Language' (originally: <code >Yet Oneother
Document Language</code>) and is basically a 
pre-processor to convert document files in a special macro language (the <code >Yodl</code> 
language) to any output format. The <code >Yodl</code> language is not a `final' language, 
in the sense that it can be viewed or printed directly. Rather, a document in 
the <code >Yodl</code> language is a `pre-document', that is converted with some macro 
package to an output format, to be further processed.
<p>
<code >Yodl</code> was designed in 1996 by Karel Kubat when he needed a good document
preprocessor to convert output to either LaTeX (for printing) or to
HTML  for publishing
via a WWW site. Although SGML does this too, he wanted something that is used
`intuitively' and with greater ease. This is reflected in the syntax of the
<code >Yodl</code> language, in the available macros of the <code >Yodl</code> macro package, and very
probably also in other aspects of <code >Yodl</code>. However, <code >Yodl</code> is designed to convert
to <em >any</em> output format; so it is possible to write a macro package that
converts <code >Yodl</code> documents to, say, the <code >man</code> format for manual pages. 
<p>
Some highlights of <code >Yodl</code>:
    <ul>
    <li> <code >Yodl</code> allows the inclusion of files. This makes it easier to split up
a document into `logical' parts, each kept in a separate file. Thus, a `main
document' file can include all the sub-parts. (Imagine that you're the editor
of a journal. Authors are likely to send in their submissions in separate
files; inclusion can then be very handy!)
    <li> Files which are included are searched for either `as-is', or in a
given `system-wide include' directory, similar to the workings of the <strong >C</strong>
preprocessor. Therefore, it is possible to create a set of include files
holding macros, and to place them into one macro directory. (See also chapter
<a href="yodl04.html#MACROPACKAGE">4</a>, where a macro package that is distributed with <code >Yodl</code> is
described.)
    <li> For all the handled files (either stated on the commandline or
included), <code >Yodl</code> supplies an extension if none is present. The default
extension is <code >.yo</code>, but can be defined to anything in the compilation of the
<code >Yodl</code> program.
    <li> <code >Yodl</code> supports conditional parsing of its input, controlled by defined
symbols. This resembles the <code >#ifdef</code> / <code >#else</code> / <code >#endif</code> preprocessor
macros of the <strong >C</strong> language. <code >Yodl</code> also supports other <code >if</code> clauses, e.g.,
to test for the presence of an argument to a macro.
    <li> <code >Yodl</code> offers hooks to define counters, to modify them, and to use them
in a document. Thereby <code >Yodl</code> offers the possibility for automatic numbering of
e.g., sections. Of course, some document languages (e.g., LaTeX) offer this
too; but some don't. When converting a <code >Yodl</code> document to, say, HTML, this
feature is very handy.
    <li> <code >Yodl</code> is designed to be easy to use: <code >Yodl</code> uses `normal' characters to
identify commands in the text, instead of insisting weird-looking tags or
escape characters.  Editing a document in the <code >Yodl</code> macro language is designed
to be as easy as possible.
    <li> Similar to other document languages, <code >Yodl</code> supports `character
conversion tables' which define how a character should appear in the output.
    </ul>
    This document first describes <code >Yodl</code> from the point of the user: how can
macros be defined, how is the program used etc.. Next, my own macro package is
presented and the macros therein described. Finally, this document holds
technical information about the installation and the inner workings of <code >Yodl</code>.

<h2 >1.1: What's new since version 4.00.00?</h2>
    In <code >Yodl</code> Version 4.00.00 some old features were removed, and several new ones
were introducted.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The following builtin commands, considered obsolete since <code >Yodl</code>
        2.00.00, were removed:
        <dl>
        <dt ><strong>DUMMY</strong></dt> no replacement.
        <dt ><strong>ENDDEF</strong></dt> DECWSLEVEL should be used;
        <dt ><strong>INCLUDELIT</strong></dt> NOEXPANDINCLUDE should be used;
        <dt ><strong>NEWCOUNTER</strong></dt> DEFINECOUNTER should be used;
        <dt ><strong>STARTDEF</strong></dt> INCWSLEVEL should be used;
        <dt ><strong>UNDEFINEMACRO</strong></dt> DELETEMACRO should be used;
        <dt ><strong>WRITEOUT</strong></dt> FPUTS should be used;
        </dl>
<p>
<li> Three new builtin commands were implemented:
        <dl>
        <dt ><strong>PUSHSUBST</strong></dt> alows temparary suppression (or activation) of
            <code >SUBST</code> definitions;
        <dt ><strong>POPSUBS</strong></dt> restores the activation type of <code >SUBST</code> definitions
        that was active just before the last <code >PUSHSUBST</code> call;
        <dt ><strong>XXSUBST</strong></dt> internally used builtin command.
        </dl>    
<p>
<li> The <code >verb</code> macro now starts with <code >PUSHSUBST(0)</code> and ends with
        <code >POPSUBST()</code>.
<p>
<li> The following macros, considered obsolete since <code >Yodl</code>
        2.00.00, were removed:
        <code >
        endcenter
        enddit
        endeit
        endit
        endmenu
        endtable
        itemize
        menu
        mit
        node
        startcenter
        startdit
        starteit
        startit
        startmenu
        starttable
        </code>
    </ul>

<h2 >1.2: Why use Yodl?</h2>
    Yodl is not a word processor, not even an editor. At first glance you might
say, yeah, why should I learn Your Own Document Language? The answer is
exactly that: because it can be <em >Your</em> own document language!
<p>
First of all, Yodl may lower the threshold of new users to start writing
documents. An example of an excellent, though not very user-friendly document
language is LaTeX. Typing all the backslash and curly brace characters in
LaTeX and remembering that an asterisk must be typed as <code >$*$</code> may be hard
at first. In such situations, a properly configured Yodl macro set removes
these obstacles and thereby helps novices. Yodl is designed to be easy to
learn.  As the Yodl package is growing, so is the manual. The ease of
`learning Yodl' may thus somewhat diminish, but just keep in mind: as long as
you need just plain texts, Yodl does OK. If you want more functionality, e.g.,
the composition of manual pages for Unix, dig into the documentation.
<p>
Second, Yodl permits to create more than one macro set, defining the same
commands, but leading to different output actions. Thereby, the same input 
file can be converted to several output formats, depending on the loaded macro 
set. In this, Yodl is a `general front' document language, which converts a 
Yodl document to a specialized language for further processing. This was of 
course one of my reasons to write Yodl: I needed a good converter for either 
LaTeX or HTML. 
<p>
Third, Yodl always allows an `escape route' to the output format. Most
situations can be handled with Yodl macros, but sure enough, some users will
want special actions for a given output format.  A typical example for the
necessity of such an escape route is the typesetting of mathematical formulas.
Say you want to use Yodl for a document that is converted either to LaTeX
(being a very good mathematical typesetter) or to HTML (a very poor
mathematical typesetter). An approach might be to decide <em >inside the
document</em> how to typeset a mathematical formula. Yodl provides conditional
command processing to accomplish this. The decision would be based on the
output format: for LaTeX, you'd typeset the formula using all the facilities
that LaTeX offers, and for HTML you'd use poor-mans typesetting. Typically,
other pre-processors for documents don't allow such escape routes. Well, Yodl
does.
