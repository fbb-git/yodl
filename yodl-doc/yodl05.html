<h1 >Chapter 5: Conversions and converters</h1>
Each macro package handling a conversion from Yodl to a given output format
has its pecularities. Although the various macro packages are very similar,
they do show some differences, due to the unique characteristics of the output
formats. Normally, these differences should not cause difficulties in
performing the conversion(s). In this chapter the conversion of a Yodl
document is covered. The currently supported document types are discussed. 
Furthermore, in this chapter the new <em >post processor</em> <code >yodlpost</code> is
described as well as a little support program: <code >yodlverbinsert</code>.
<p>
<a name="l321"></a>
<h2 >5.1: Conversion script invocations</h2>
    Yodl is distributed with scripts  named <code >yodl2latex</code>, <code >yodl2html</code> and 
other <code >yodl2...</code> drivers. Invocations like
        <pre>

    yodl2latex file
        
</pre>

    causes <code >Yodl</code> to process <code >file.yo</code> and to write output to
<code >file.latex</code>. The extension of the input file, <code >.yo</code>, is the default <code >Yodl</code>
extension; the extension of the output file, <code >.latex</code>, is given by the name
of the shell script. Analogously, <code >yodl2html</code> writes to a file having the
extension <code >.html</code>.
<p>
The conversion scripts auto-load the macro file appropriate for the
conversion: <code >latex.yo</code> for LaTeX conversions, <code >html.yo</code> for HTML
conversions, etc.. The macro files are in <code >Yodl</code>'s standard include directory
(which is mentioned in <code >Yodl</code>'s usage information when <code >Yodl</code> is started without
arguments). If the include directory is altered in such a way that it doesn't
contain a path to the default directory anymore, then <code >Yodl</code> won't be able to
auto-load the conversion specific macro files, producing unexpected
results. This can be prevented by specifying the literal text <code >$STD_INCLUDE</code>
in a user-defined path setting.
<p>
When the conversion scripts themselves are started without arguments, usage
information is shown about the conversion scripts.
<p>
Depending on the conversion type, the following output is produced:
    <ul>
    <li> For LaTeX conversions, one output file with the extension <code >.latex</code>
is written. 
    <li> For HTML conversions, several files may be written; one file per
chapter of the original document. When the document is not sectioned by
chapters, only one output file is produced.
<p>
The `main' output file always has the name of the input file but with
extension <code >.html</code>. This file holds the document title and the table of
contents. When more than one output files are created, then they are named
<code >name01.html</code>, <code >name02.html</code> etc., where <code >name</code> is the original name of
the input file. E.g., a document <code >prog.yo</code> might lead to <code >prog.html</code>,
<code >prog01.html</code> etc..
    
    <li> For man conversions, one output file with the extension <code >.man</code> is
written. 
    <li> For text conversions, the converter is named <code >yodl2txt</code> and one 
output file with the extension <code >.txt</code> is created.
    <li> For XML conversions, the converter is named <code >yodl2xml</code> and output
files are produced comparably to the way they are produced with the <code >html</code>
conversion: one file per chapter if chapters are used, otherwise one single
output file, having the extension(s) <code >.xml</code>.
</ul>
    The `second-phase' scripts, distributed with earlier versions of <code >Yodl</code>, are
no longer part of <code >Yodl</code>'s distribution, as they do not relate directly to
<code >Yodl</code>'s actions. They may remain useful, though, as leftovers from earlier
distributions.
    
<p>

<h2 >5.2: The HTML converter</h2>    
    HTML doesn't support automatic section numbering or resolving of
label/reference pairs. The converter takes care of this. Other target
languages (e.g., XML, text) suffer from the same problems.
<p>
<a name="l323"></a>
<h4 >5.2.0.1: Direct commands to HTML</h4>
        Similar to the LaTeX converter, you can use either <code >NOTRANS</code> or
<code >htmlcommand</code> to send HTML commands to the output. Or, since the only 
`difficult' characters are probably only <code >&lt;</code> and <code >&gt;</code>, you can also resort 
to <code >CHAR</code> for these two characters.
<p>
Furthermore, the HTML converter defines the macro <code >htmltag</code>, expecting two 
arguments: the tag to set, and an `on/off' switch. E.g., <code >htmltag(b)(1)</code> 
sets <code >&lt;b&gt;</code> while <code >htmltag(b)(0)</code> sets <code >&lt;/b&gt;</code>.
<p>
E.g., the following code sends a HTML command <code >&lt;hr&gt;</code> to the output file when 
in HTML mode:
        <pre>
COMMENT(-- alternative 1, using htmlcommand --)
    htmlcommand(&lt;hr&gt;)
    
    COMMENT(-- alternative 2, using NOTRANS --)
    IFDEF(html)(
        NOTRANS(&lt;hr&gt;)
    )()
    
    COMMENT(-- alternative 3, using CHAR --)
    IFDEF(html)(
        CHAR(&lt;)hrCHAR(&gt;)
    )()
        
    COMMENT(-- alternative 4, using htmltag --)
    htmltag(hr)(1)
        
</pre>

<p>
<a name="l324"></a>
<h4 >5.2.0.2: Section numbering</h4>
        The HTML converter numbers its own sections. This is handled internally.
However, the current converter only can number sections as starting at 1, and
outputs the numbers in arabic numerals (you can't number with A, B, etc..).
<p>
<a name="l325"></a>
<h2 >5.3: The LaTeX converter</h2>    
    The LaTeX converter is, from <code >Yodl</code>'s viewpoint, an easy one: since
LaTeX supports wide functionality, a Yodl document is basically just
re-mapped to LaTeX commands. No post-processing by <code >yodlpost</code> is
required.
<p>
<a name="l326"></a>
<h4 >5.3.0.1: Direct commands to LaTeX</h4>    
        To send LaTeX commands directly to the output, use the <code >latexcommand()</code>
macro (see section <a href="yodl04.html#FORMATDEFINES">4.3.1</a>), or use <code >NOTRANS</code> (see section
<a href="yodl03.html#NOTRANS">3.1.40</a>). The advantage of the <code >latexcommand</code> macro is that it only
outputs its argument when in LaTeX mode.
<p>
The following two code fragments both output <code >\pagestyle{plain}</code> when in 
LaTeX mode: 
        <pre>

    COMMENT(-- First alternative: --)
    latexcommand(\pagestyle{plain})
    
    COMMENT(-- Second alternative: --)
    IFDEF(latex)(
        NOTRANS(\pagestyle{plain})
    )()
        
</pre>
 
<p>
<a name="l327"></a>
<h4 >5.3.0.2: Verbatim text</h4>    
        The Yodl macro package defines two macros that generate verbatim text (e.g.,
source code listings). These macros are <code >verb()</code> and <code >tt()</code>.
    <dl>
    <dt ><strong>verb</strong></dt> The <code >verb()</code> macro and is meant for longer listings (whole
files); as in:
        <pre>

        verb(
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main (int argc, char **argv)
    {
        printf ("Hello World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
        )
        
</pre>

    The <code >verb()</code> macro generates <code >\begin{verbatim}</code> and
<code >\end{verbatim}</code> when used in LaTeX conversion mode.
That means that (in that situation) the <code >verb</code> macro has only one caveat:
you cannot put <code >\end{verbatim}</code> into it.
    <dt ><strong>tt</strong></dt> The <code >tt()</code> macro also inserts verbatim text. It is used for
short in-line strings (e.g, <code >**argv</code>). The LaTeX converter doesn't
actually use a verbatim mode, but sets the characters in teletype font.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="l328"></a>
<h2 >5.4: The man converter</h2>    
    Manual pages can be constructed using the special <code >yodl2man</code> converter.
This converter assumes that the manual page has been designed using the
<code >manpage()</code> macro. Yodl (and thus the <code >yodl2man</code> converter, when conerting
man-pages, skips all leading white space on lines. Paragraphs are supported,
though. An empty line separates paragraphs.
<p>
<a name="l329"></a>
<h4 >5.4.0.1: Direct commands to man</h4>
        Either <code >NOTRANS</code> or <code >mancommand</code> can be used to send man commands to the
output. 
<p>
E.g., the following code sends a MAN command <code >&lt;hr&gt;</code> to the output file when 
in MAN mode:
        <pre>
COMMENT(-- alternative 1, using mancommand --)
    mancommand(&lt;hr&gt;)
    
    COMMENT(-- alternative 2, using NOTRANS --)
    IFDEF(man)(
        NOTRANS(&lt;hr&gt;)
    )()
        
</pre>

<p>
<a name="l330"></a>
<h2 >5.5: The txt converter</h2>    
    Plain text documents can be constructed using the <code >yodl2txt</code> converter.
This converter resolves all references into the document itself, so
postprocessing is required. 
<p>
<a name="l331"></a>
<h4 >5.5.0.1: Direct commands to txt</h4>
        Either <code >NOTRANS</code> or <code >txtcommand</code> can be used to send txt commands to the
output. 
<p>
E.g., the following code sends a TXT command <code >&lt;hr&gt;</code> to the output file when 
in TXT mode:
        <pre>
COMMENT(-- alternative 1, using txtcommand --)
    txtcommand(&lt;hr&gt;)
    
    COMMENT(-- alternative 2, using NOTRANS --)
    IFDEF(txt)(
        NOTRANS(&lt;hr&gt;)
    )()
        
</pre>

<p>
<a name="l332"></a>
<h2 >5.6: The experimental XML converter</h2>    
    The XML converter is experimental. It was added to <code >Yodl</code> to allow me to write
documents for the horrible `webplatform' of the university of Groningen. The
XML support files (located in the <code >xml</code> directory in the standard macro's
directory) clearly reflect this target. Although experimental, they were kept
because the XML macros support interesting constructions allowing <code >Yodl</code> to
handle closing tags somewhat more strict than required for HTML.
<p>
<a name="l333"></a>
<h2 >5.7: The Yodl Post-processor `yodlpost'</h2>
    Following the conversion of a <code >Yodl</code> text, most target-languages require an
additional operation, called `post-processing'. Post-processing is required
for various reasons: to split the output in separate files (HTML, XML); to
fixup the locations of labels, that are referred to earlier than the labels
are defined (virtually all target language except LaTeX); tables of contents
are available only after the conversion, but have to be inserted at the
beginning of the document; etc. etc..
<p>
Starting with <code >Yodl</code> V. 2.00 there is only one post-processor, handling all
the conversions for all target languages. Program maintenance of just one
program is certainly easier than maintenance of as many programs as there are
target-languages, at the expense of only a slightly larger program: after all,
the one post-processor contains the conversion procedures for all target
languages. It turns out that this is a very minimal drawback. See section
<a href="yodl06.html#POSTPROCESSOR">6.7</a> for the technical details of post-processor program
maintenance. 
<p>
The post-processor that is distributed since <code >Yodl</code> V. 2.00 does <em >not</em> use the
<code >.tt(Yodl)TAGSTART.</code> and <code >.tt(Yodl)TAGEND.</code> tags anymore. Instead, the conversion
process produces a <em >index file</em> in which comparable information is
written. The advantage of using an index file is that the postprocessor
doesn't have to parse the output file generated by <code >Yodl</code> twice (once to
determine the tags, once to process the tags), which by itself accelerates the
conversion process; and (albeit of a somewhat limited practical importance)
that the tags are no longer <em >reserved words</em>: authors may put
<code >.tt(Yodl)TAGSTART.</code> and <code >.tt(Yodl)TAGEND.</code> into their texts as often as they
want. 
<p>
Authors should be aware of some caveats with respect to some target languages:
    <dl>
    <dt ><strong>man- and ms- conversions</strong></dt> all dots are converted by the active
character conversion table to <code >\&amp;.</code>. Commands in these languages always
start with a dot as the first character on a line. In order to insert these
commands the <code >roffcmd()</code> (see section <code >MACROLIST</code>) should be used.
    <dt ><strong>plain text conversions</strong></dt> As stated before, the ASCII converter
basically only strips macronames from its input. This converter is so basic,
that it should only be used as a last
resort, when no other target language is available for the job.
        <br/>
    With the plain text converer, the layout of the input file is very
important, as the output is basically the same as the input. The only
exception to this rule are multiple empty lines, which normally are consumed
by the post-processor, to be replaced by one single empty line.
    <dt ><strong>sgml conversions</strong></dt> the SGML converter was implemented for historic
reasons. It is by no means complete, and can at best be considered an `initial
starting point'. Currently, the SGML converter only supports the <code >article</code>
document type, having <code >sect</code> as its top-level sectioning command.
    <dt ><strong>xml conversions</strong></dt> The XML converter was implemented to allow me
(Frank) to produce XML text as defined by the so-called `webplatform' of the
University of Groningen. A completely pathological implementation of XML,
crippling its users to the level of the `double click brigade'. Well, so be
it. The net result of this is that <code >Yodl</code> now offers some basic form  of XML
conversion. After adding XML conversion, however, there was never any real
situation where it could profitably be used. Therefore, further develpment of
the XML conversion has, for the time being, been suspended.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="l334"></a>
<h2 >5.8: The support program `yodlverbinsert'</h2>
        The program <code >yodlverbinsert</code> is a simple <strong >C</strong> support program that
can be used to generate <code >verb()</code>-sections in <code >Yodl</code> files
from sections of existing files. The files from which sections are included
are usually <strong >C</strong> or <strong >Cpp</strong> source files, accepting either <code >//</code> or
<code >/*</code>-style comment. 
<p>
<code >Yodlverbinsert</code> offers the possibility to indent both the initial
<code >verb</code>-statement and the inserted file contents. Furthermore, an additional
empty line may be inserted before the first line that is actually inserted.
The program is invoked according to the following synopsis:
<p>
<div style="text-align: center"><strong >yodlverbinsert</strong> [OPTIONS] <code >marker file</code></div>
<p>
The arguments have the following meanings;
    <ul>
    <li> <code >marker</code><br/>
    The argument <code >marker</code> must start in <code >file</code>'s first column en must
either start as a standard <strong >C</strong> or <strong >C++</strong> comment: <code >//</code> or <code >/*</code> must be
used. Following that, the remainder of the argument is used as a label, e.g.,
<code >//label</code>, <code >/*LABEL*/</code>. The label may contain non-alpha characters as
well. Except for the first two characters and their locations no special
restrictions imposed upon the label texts. A labeled section ends at the next
<code >//=</code> (when the label started with <code >//</code>) or at the next <code >/**/</code> (when the
label started with <code >/*</code>). Like the labels, the end-markers must also start
in the file's first column.
    <li> <code >file</code><br/>
    The argument <code >file</code> must be an existing file. <code >Yodlverbinsert</code> was
designed with <strong >C</strong> or <strong >C++</strong> sources in minde, from which labeled sections
must be inserted into a <code >Yodl</code> document, but <code >file</code> could also refer to
another type of (text) file.
    </ul>
<p>
The default values of options are listed below, with each of the options
between square brackets. The defaults were chosen so that <code >yodlverbinsert</code>
performs the behavior of an earlier version of this program, which was
not distributed with <code >Yodl</code>.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >-N</strong><br/>
    Do not write a newline immediately following <code >verb</code>-statement's
open-parenthesis. By default it is written, causing an additional line to be
inserted before the first line that's actually inserted from a file.
    <li> <strong >-s</strong> <code >spaces</code> [0]<br/>
        start each line that is written into the <code >verb</code>-section with
<code >spaces</code> additional blanks.
    <li> <strong >-S</strong> <code >spaces</code> [8]<br/>
        prefix the <code >verb</code> of the <code >verb</code>-section by 
<code >spaces</code> additional blanks.
    <li> <strong >-t</strong> <code >tabs</code> [0]<br/>
        start each line that is written into the <code >verb</code>-section with
<code >tabs</code> additional tab characters. If both <code >-s</code> and <code >-t</code> are specified,
the tabs are inserted first.
    <li> <strong >-T</strong> <code >tabs</code> [0]<br/>
        prefix the <code >verb</code> of the <code >verb</code>-section by <code >tabs</code> additional tab
characters. If both <code >-S</code> and <code >-T</code> are specified, the tabs are inserted
first.
    </ul>
<p>
<code >Yodlverbinsert</code> writes its selected section to its standard output
stream.
<p>
<a name="l335"></a>
<h3 >5.8.1: Example</h3>
<p>
Assume the file <code >demo</code> contains the following text:
        <pre>

preceding text

//one
one 1

//=

/*two*/

    two

/**/

trailing text
    
</pre>

<p>
Then the following commands write the shown output to the program's
standard output:
    <ul>
    <li> <code >verbinclude //one demo</code><br/>
        <pre>
        verb(
one 1

)

</pre>

    <li> <code >verbinclude -N //one demo</code><br/>
        <pre>
        verb(one 1

)

</pre>

    <li> <code >verbinclude -s4 '/*two*/' demo</code><br/>
        <pre>
        verb(
    
        two
    
)

</pre>

    </ul>        
<p>
To call <code >yodlverbinsert</code> from a <code >Yodl</code> document, use
<strong >PIPETHROUGH</strong>. E.g., 
        <pre>

    PIPETHROUGH(yodlverbinsert //one demo)
        
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, define a simple macro like the macro <code >verbinsert</code>:
    
    <pre>

DEFINEMACRO(verbinsert)(2)(PIPETHROUGH(yodlverbinsert //ARG1 ARG2)()\ 
)
    
</pre>

    which may be a useful macro if all or most of your labeled sections start
with <code >//</code>, and if <code >yodlverbinsert</code>'s arguments don't vary much. Variants
to this macro can easily be conceived of.
